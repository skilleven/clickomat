# Clickomat 1.0.0

Python-Script for automated click-sequences and text entry.

Building on top of the brilliant lib "pyautogui" by [Al Sweigart](https://github.com/asweigart)
it offers the possibility to perform mouse clicks, text input and more with very simplified commands.

The purpose of Clickomat is to map the sometimes relatively long python commands from pyautogui with short,
single-line commands that are processed in a simple text list.


<br><br>


> ### New in 1.0.0:
>
> **lookup**: Multiple targets possible \
> **blacklist:** Define target(s) which abort complete script immediately if found. \
> **whitelist:** Define target(s) which HAVE TO BE visible on screen. If not, script is also aborted immediately.
>
> These functions will be executed as separate threads which means they will not slow down the performance of the main running section.
>
> `blacklist` and `whitelist` can be used to implement panic-switches.
>
> **pop:** User defined popup messages.
>
> Plus: Proper implementation of pyautogui's failsave -> if the mouse is manually positioned in one of the screen corners a panic-switch fires.

<br><br>

> ### Next Milestone: v1.0.0
> * No new features
> * Hunt bugs to make a stable 1.0.0

## Installation
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPI%20package-1.0.0-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=Pypi&logoColor=white)](https://pypi.org/project/clickomat/)


```
$ pip install clickomat
```

<br><br>


### Run Testscript

Open https://checkboxolympics.com/ in Firefox (Chrome should work also). \
It must now be ensured that ALT-TAB (Win) or CMD-TAB (Mac) can be used to switch directly back and forth between the terminal and the website.

1) Install Clickomat package
```
$ pip install clickomat
```
2) Change directory into testcases/checkboxolympics/
```
$ cd [path-to-clickomat-folder]/testcases/checkboxolympics
```
3) Run the script by typing

```
$ python c.py
```

OR simply put
```
$ pip install clickomat
...
$ clickomat -p [path-to-clickomat-folder]/testcases/checkboxolympics

```

<br><br>

### Run Clickomat


#### From command-line as CLI
If run directly from command-line Clickomat takes arguments like this:

```
$ clickomat -p C:/path/to/case/dir -c clicklist.txt -i imagefolder
```
Defaults would simply be '.','t1.txt','images' if called w/o arguments.

If you only like to change the clicklist-file:

```
$ clickomat -c clicklist.txt
```
More details in the [Docs -> CLI](https://github.com/skilleven/clickomat/wiki/CLI)

<br>

#### From python-file

To run from python-script you need to have at least this construct:
```python
from clickomat import Clickomat
c = Clickomat('.','t1.txt',"images")
c.main()
```
* You have to specify the location of your clicklist with the first param. Here it is a dot because the python file is in the same directory as the Clickomat script txt-file (clicklist).
* Next is the name of the clicklist (text-file) to read instructions from `t1.txt`
* You CAN specify a folder for your target-images but those can also be located on txt-file level. Then you would write a dot here.
